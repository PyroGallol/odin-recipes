Recipe Project

The current project aims to create a new website containing several recipes
using basic html and css only

At the end of the project i was able to :

~ Make use of the different display properties (inline-block, block and inline) and what elements are inline or block by default

~ Learn how to use the border-box property for all elements at once as i learned this was a common practice among developers

~ Create and style ordered and unordered lists

~ Center text and items using various centring methods like the margin trick and text-align property

~ Attach links and "Style Sheet" to an html page

~ Inspect elements and editing them using the chrome dev tools
